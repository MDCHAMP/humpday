## Citing HumpDay

If you wish to cite HumpDay, thanks and maybe for now: 

     @electronic{cottonhumpday,
          title = {{HumpDay Optimization Package}},
          year = {2021},
          author = {Peter Cotton},
          url = {https://github.com/microprediction/humpday}
      }
      
 Although I have a book soonish: 
 
        @electronic{cottonbook,
          title = {{Microprediction: Why the Right Price for AI is Zero}},
          year = {2022},
          author = {Peter Cotton},
          publisher = {MIT Press}
      }
      
 which motivates HumpDay and other packages. I'm trying to collate the best way to cite auto-this-and-that here. If you are the author of a package and would like to add or amend, please do so (PR's welcome)
